## 📄 Document Search Examples


PageIndex currently enables reasoning-based RAG within a single document by default.
For users who need to search across multiple documents, we provide three best-practice workflows below for different scenarios.

* [**Search by Metadata**](doc-search/metadata) for documents that can be distinguished by metadatas.
* [**Search by Semantics**:](doc-search/semantic) for documents with different semantic content or cover diverse topics.
* [**Search by Description**:](doc-search/description) a lightweight document strategy for small amount of documents.
