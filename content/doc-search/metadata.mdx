##  Metadata-based Document Search
<Callout>PageIndex with metadata support is in closed beta. Fill out this form to request early access to this feature.</Callout>

For documents that can be easily distinguished by metadata, we recommend using metadata to search the documents.

**Examples Documents:**

- Financial reports categorized by company and time period
- Legal documents categorized by case type
- Medical records categorized by patient or condition
- And many others

In such cases, you can search documents  by leveraging their metadata. A popular method is to use "Query to SQL" for  document retrieval.


#### Example Pipeline
<Steps>
#### 1. PageIndex Tree Generation
Upload all the document into PageIndex to get their `doc_id`.

#### 2. Set up SQL tables

Store documents along with their metadata and the PageIndex `doc_id` in a database table.

#### 3. Query to SQL

Use an LLM to transform a user‚Äôs retrieval request into a SQL query to fetch relevant documents.

#### 4. Retrieve with PageIndex

Use the PageIndex `doc_id` of the retrieved documents to perform further retrieval via the PageIndex retrieval API.
